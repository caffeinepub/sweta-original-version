# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revert the site’s content back to the original Sweta romantic version in `frontend/src/App.tsx`.

**Planned changes:**
- Update all user-facing text in `frontend/src/App.tsx` to consistently use “Sweta” (removing any remaining “Kavya ji” references).
- Restore the story/occasion/date references in `frontend/src/App.tsx` to “29 November” (removing any “Rose Day” references).
- Restore romantic section titles, romantic relationship framing, and letter/signature wording in `frontend/src/App.tsx` (removing friendship-only phrasing).
- Update relevant image `alt` text in `frontend/src/App.tsx` to use “Sweta” wherever a person-name is used, and ensure it does not mention “Kavya ji”.

**User-visible outcome:** The site reads as the original romantic Sweta version again, including the “29 November” story date and consistent Sweta naming across text and image alt text.
